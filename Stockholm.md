# Stockholm

Last updated: 30/10/2022

Stockholm is a beautiful Scandinavian city with roughly 1 million inhabitants. It is closely connected to nature and water. 3 days is the perfect time to see the city's highlights. Go there in the summer (June-July) to enjoy the very long sunny days with mild temperatures, or in December to experience a dark but cozy city with snow and Christmas vibes.

## [Travel Map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1t0eUgRGVS-4g6m0dJgfpUyn4jzGe_Oo&ehbc=2E312F)🗺️

## Weather🌡️

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/197390272-3d3b574d-1084-42c0-902d-c1cb8e9b07fb.PNG" alt="" width="400" />

## Prices📈

Sweden is considered to be an expensive country in Europe. In general, it is twice as costly as Hungary. Services involving people tend to be even more expensive. Some cheaper grocery stores have similar prices to Hungary.

Swedish Kronor (SEK) is the Swedish currency. 1 EUR ~ 11 SEK ~ 38 HUF (live data [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=eur+sek)). They don’t accept Euro (usually). Don’t bring cash, it is hard to pay by cash here. I recommend to use Revolut and have a SEK account there.


## Airport transfer✈️

### Arlanda

Read a great summary [here](https://www.sweetsweden.com/tourism-travel-sweden/the-cheapest-way-to-travel-between-arlanda-airport-and-stockholm/).

- If you want to go cheap, you can travel for free with public transport ticket, but you need to take bus line 583, then a commuter train at Märsta Station (if you go to Stockholm). It takes roughly 90 minutes.

- If you wanna go relatively cheap, there is [FlixBus](https://global.flixbus.com/) or [Flygbussarna](https://www.flygbussarna.se/) between Arlanda and T-Centralen (Stockholm City Center). It takes around 50 minutes, costs around 110 SEK.

- If you wanna go super fast but expensive, take the [Arlanda Express](https://www.arlandaexpress.com/). It is a high-speed train making the way only in 18 minutes, costs 149 SEK.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/196000265-02e6f7ea-2696-443e-a468-00bf9b81182b.jpg" alt="Arlanda Express" width="400" />

### Skavsta

There are good and bad news: Skavsta airport is actually not anywhere close to Stockholm, but 100 km away. The good part: the airport is small, the security check-in is not that strict, and you cannot get lost. You need around 1.5 hour from Stockholm city center to get there.

- I recommend [Flygbussarna](https://www.flygbussarna.se/) between Skavsta and T-Centralen (Stockholm City Center). It takes around 90 minutes, costs around 210 SEK. Buy your ticket before getting to the station, because it costs more there.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/196000146-c4cb4a04-056d-43fd-88f6-47a8e0b482e5.jpg" alt="Flygbussarna" width="400" />


## Public Transport🚇

T-Centralen is the center of the city, you can reach anywhere from there easily. You should buy a ticket with SL (public transpot company). It is expensive, but the service is great, and you can get anywhere for free (including ferries and commuter trains within Stockholm county). [Tickets](https://sl.se/privat/biljetter/kop-biljett) (The 72 hour ticket is 330 SEK, the 7 day ticket costs 420 SEK - they are pretty expensive). Unfortunatelly the student ticket is only valid with a Mecenat card, no international or EU compatible student ID is accepted. Download the SL app ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sl.SLBiljetter&hl=en&gl=US), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/se/app/sl-reseplanerare-och-biljetter/id918418291)) to buy your ticket (you can travel with it while being offline).

## Transportation alternatives🚴‍♀️

The inner city has many attractions within walking distance. If you occasionally want to go to the outer suburbs, I recommend you buy single tickets (valid for 90 minutes) and walk otherwise.

Riding a bike is one of the best absolute best ways to experience Stockholm. Stockholm is very biker friendly, you can reach anywhere, weather can be the only constraint. I see Stockholm eBikes quite often. An article of bike rental services [here](https://viewstockholm.com/rent-bike-stockholm/).

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/198880478-cd832129-f1f6-45d8-8432-8a30854e50c9.jpg" alt="" width="400" />


## Car rental/carsharing🚗

If you stay only in Stockholm, you don't really need a car. The public transport is great, and you need to pay an extra fee to enter the city.

If you need a car, I can recommend [Circle K](https://www.circlek.se/biluthyrning), which is a petrol station franchise also renting out cars.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/198880433-b3b74c85-afda-4628-9772-406e884e4164.png" alt="" width="400" />

    The old city with historical and medieval streets, souvenir shops, fika places, and with the tightest street in Stockholm (Mårten Trotzigs Gränd). On the main square (Stortorget), you can find one of the the most iconic photo spots in Stockholm. The square hosts a nice Christmas market in winter.

- [ ] **Djurgårdsfärjan (Djurgården ferry)** 🆓

    Start the ride from Slussen. Free with an SL ticket, and gives a nice overview of the inner city. You can see Gröna Lund and hear people screaming on the way. It stops in Slussen, Djurgården, and Skeppsholmen.
    
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/196001348-4b786c54-5ae0-4b3b-8ff7-9d97b60e10b2.jpg" alt="" width="400" />
    
- [ ] **Djurgården** 🆓

    One of my favourite places in the city. It is a very nice island with tons of museums. Apart from them, I usually come here to the park walk around and enjoy the sun. It used to be a hunting venue for the royal family.
    
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/198877994-77c7ef06-ab9c-4459-85fa-7226cc12e292.jpg" alt="" width="400" />
    
- [ ] **Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan (KTH Royal Institute of Technology)** 🆓

    This is the Technical University where I studied. I recommend to visit the main campus, the garden in front of it, and the library. The libary is open during weekdays usually, but check the [opening hours](https://www.kth.se/en/biblioteket).
    
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/198878042-01dc7289-ee8d-42a5-af72-987217455ea1.jpg" alt="The main campus" width="400" />

- [ ] **Svampen** 🆓

    A popular meeting place in Stockholm. This is the area where Avicii grew up. Svampen means mushroom.

- [ ] **Birthplace of the Stockholm Syndrome** 🆓

    The robbery at Norrmalmstorg in 1973 took an unexpected turn when the hostages started sympathizing with their captors. In an instant the Stockholm Syndrome was born. [Story](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/birthplace-of-the-stockholm-syndrome).

    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/197397642-290bea74-78ce-45d0-81ad-cb367a3e1bbe.jpg" alt="" width="400" />

- [ ] **Nobels spränggropar (Nobel's Blasting Bunkers)** 🆓

    Vinterviken was once the location of the world’s first commercial nitroglycerine factory and the basis for Alfred Nobel’s success ([story](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/197397826-d75b76cc-61e3-45dc-81da-7506533e53e8.jpg)). Vinterviken is a 15-20 minute walk away from the metro station Aspudden on the red line.

- [ ] **Lappis** 🆓

    Lappis is a nice student area with a nice beach. It is close to the nature, and has great surroundings to walk. There is a Japanese pond and a botanical garden nearby.
    
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/196002676-47ba3124-4f66-4edc-9725-d7d32a4e8b1c.jpg" alt="" width="400" />
    
### Activities🤿

- [ ] **Spotify HQ visit** 🆓

    The HQ is in Stockholm. A Spotify employee can have visitors if the office. There are games (pool, table tennis, shuffleboard, darts), a karaoke and a gaming room. The view of Stockholm is really nice from there.
    
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/198878152-ee87f4d4-8e14-41c5-9c50-c0e821981783.jpg" alt="" width="400" />
    
- [ ] **Gröna Lund** around 450 SEK (prices vary)

    An amazing amusement park. They offer half day tickets (Ticket to Ride), almost every ride is for free. The ticket is expensive, but personally I liked this place very much. They have a night option too (Night Rider) for even higher prices. They have seasonal events as well, like Oktoberfest or Halloween. [Link](https://www.google.com/search?q=gr%C3%B6na+lund)
    
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/198878185-0cdd3e1b-fae3-4fb8-bc07-39fa40af1d27.jpg" alt="" width="400" />
    
- [ ] **Waxholmsbolaget (Vaxholm ferry)** 🆓

    [Vaxholm](https://www.google.com/search?q=vaxholm+fortress) is a fortress in the archipelago. The fortress itself is not that extraordinary, but the ferry ride and the area is. One can get there by ferry for free with an SL pass during weekdays ([line 83](https://appassets.mvtdev.com/map/155/l/1083/26618759.pdf)). On weekends, a ticket is needed. It is relatively far, takes around 80 minutes to get there, so it is a (half)day trip going there and coming back. I do not necessarily recommend to go to the fortress museum, it costs 100 SEK. It is possible to take a bus to/from Vaxholm too.
    
    There are good restaurants there, like Boulangerie Bistro (Italian/Swedish food), Hamnkrogen (Swedish dishes).
    
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/196002274-1d5db6da-e5c6-44ac-be63-064f9aeecef8.jpg" alt="" width="400" />
    
- [ ] **Hiking in Tyresta National Park** 🆓

    Stockholm has numerous great hiking venues all around the city. Tyresta is a National Park having many hiking trails starting from 5 km to even 30 km. I hiked on the short trail, it took me around 2 hours. This is definitely a (half)day activity as it takes around 1-1,5 hour to get there by public transport. [Link](https://www.google.com/search?q=gr%C3%B6na+lund)
    
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/198878237-469ed87d-a1ca-49ad-ba90-600feb12f6dd.jpg" alt="" width="400" />

- [ ] **Hiking in Lidingö (Långängen-Elfviks naturreservat, Bäverhyddan)** 🆓

    Lidingö is an island on the North-East with beautiful nature and hiking trails. There is a good fika place in the forest called Långängens Gård.
    
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/197342901-7b8db9cf-9ef6-4573-a7f9-fe7fb63aa697.jpg" alt="" width="400" />

- [ ] **Drottningholm slott** 💸

    Versailles of Sweden. As everything is relatively small in Stockholm, don’t expect too much, and it is a bit far from the city center (around 40 minutes). The royal family lives there, but half of the castle can be visited with a ticket (it costs around 110-200 SEK, depending on the type). The whole castle is on an island, which served as a hunting venue for the royal family. It has a nice green area with lakes and fountains (as you would expect from a royal family). There are also other buildings nearby, such as the chinese pavilion. [Link](https://www.kungligaslotten.se/english/royal-palaces-and-sites/drottningholm-palace.html)
    
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/196002513-7bbc3796-13e4-44f4-8314-5dc527d5c9b5.jpg" alt="" width="400" />
    
- [ ] **Kayaking** 270 SEK or 🆓

    Link to a great place: [LEK MER | Pampas kajak & SUP](https://www.lekmer.nu/tour/hyra-kajak/). Renting out a double kayak is 540 SEK for 2 hours, which is okay. Going around the whole island of Stadshagen is possible in 2 hours. Being more chill and avoiding waves, one can just go through the tunnel until reaching the Stadshuseet. Pampas Marina is a restaurant right next to the kayaking place. They offer all you can eat lunch and great food, but watch out for the seagulls.

    There is an option to collect trash and paddle for free in exchange, for example [here](https://www.smartakartan.se/en/stockholm/green-kayak/).
    
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/196002638-a0d7c98a-2332-4b13-be97-fa4ee12a049a.jpg" alt="" width="400" />

- [ ] **Metro Art** 🆓

    The Stockholm Tunelbana (metro) has more than a hundred stations, and at least ninety of them have art installations as part of their decoration. Traveling by subway is like being in a personal, mobile art gallery that allows to experience the beauty of mosaics, paintings, installations, and sculptures. Admission costs nothing except for the train ticket. I definitely recommend exploring it on a dark or cold day. 
    
    The following stations are interesting: **Thorildsplan**, **Tensta**, **Tekniska Högskolan**, **T-Centralen** (blue line part), **Stadion**, **Solna Strand**, **Solna Centrum**, **Östermalmstorg**, **Mörby Centrum**, **Kungsträdgården**, **Hötorget**, **Hallonbergen**, **Citybanan Odenplan**, **Bagarmossen**, and **Universitetet**.

- [ ] **Sigtuna** 🆓

    A cozy little viking village around 1-1,5 hour from Stockholm by public transport (bus). This was the old capital of Sweden, which lost its influence after Stockholm started to collect tax from passing ships between Sigtuna and the sea. The city does not have much things to show in general. During winter, it has a nice charm, the sunsets are beautiful, and people usually do hiking or ice-skating on the frozen sea.
    
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/198878405-6238e098-c97f-4813-8a7a-4d39b217f5fd.jpg" alt="" width="400" />
    
- [ ] **Fox in a Box** around 350 SEK

    It is an escape room place, and they also have boardgames to play. [Link](https://foxinabox.se/)
    
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/196002652-916173c9-8ffa-4ca0-96dd-015f66647b9a.jpg" alt="" width="400" />

- [ ] **Djurönäset Konferens & Hotell** 💸💸

    A SPA and conference venue in the woods with a hotel and a restaurant. It is located in the archipelago (30 minutes from Stockholm by car). I don't know if there is public tansport there. A little bit pricey, but the atmosphere is nice. You can go to the sauna, enjoy the outdoor pool, or dip into the sea. [Link](https://djuronaset.com)
    
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/198878440-5d1ea574-19d0-4dbe-9b4e-3d85e3399745.jpg" alt="" width="400" />

- [ ] **Auora hunting** 🆓

    Aurora is Stockholm? It can happen, although it is unlikely. The chances are the best between November and February but it happened in Aug too (unlikely). If you really want to see them, go to the north (Abisko or Björkliden). You need a place far from the city center (no light pollution) to see it. If you wanna hunt the aurora, download [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jrustonapps.myauroraforecast) app from the Play Store. When it alerts you that there is a chance, and the sky is clear, go to Lappis beach or Nacka to see it. You need a KP index higher than 4-5 to have a good chance.

### Museums and tours🏛️

- [ ] **Vasamuseet** 190 SEK

    Museum of a monumental, 400 year old wooden ship, I think it is amazing! (but I kinda like ships) [Link](https://www.google.com/search?q=vasamuseet)

### Hidden gems🔍

- [ ] **Humor skulptur**

    When leaving the metro at Slussen train station, visitors find a square where most people pass by without giving a second glance. But those who do will notice a hidden piece of art. Can you find it? The sculpture is modeled after Hasse Alfredson, a Swedish comedian and actor.

    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/197394765-9152e443-bdfe-4590-8807-f9f45ecbd929.jpg" alt="" width="400" />

- [ ] **Östermalm Echo Dome**

    The echo chamber on the way to the metro is a large round room with a spherical roof made out of concrete. The spherical roof bounces sound back and forth in a very unintuitive way. It makes it so even the quietest whisper on the other side of the room can be heard perfectly, but people next to you are not more audible at all. Stand in the center of the room, and you'll hear everything that is said around you, and everyone will also hear you.

    Apart from all the practical jokes you can play here, it's amusing to see people look around with a confused face when they walk alone and suddenly hear other people talking, their voices carrying as if they were right next to them. 

    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/198878742-a0cf5dd6-24b9-4e8d-9209-b158c569c376.jpg" alt="" width="400" />

- [ ] **Stockholms Geographical Midpoint** 🆓

    People refer T-Centralen as the center of Stockholm. To find the actual midpoint, take the metro (green line) to Alvik and walk from there. It is roughly 3 minutes from there.

    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/197395918-5bfd10b4-4451-4945-8bd7-b824e6bb3e31.jpg" alt="" width="400" />

- [ ] **Sweden Solar System**

    The [Sweden Solar System](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sweden-solar-system) is the world's largest model of our planetary system, at a scale of 1:20 million.

    The sun is represented by the Globe Arena in Stockholm, the largest spherical building in the world. The planets, all appropriately scaled, are all around Stockholm and its suburbs. Jupiter (diameter 7.3 m) is at the Arlanda Airport, Saturn is in Uppsala, and Pluto in Delsbo, 300 km from the Globe Arena. At each planet, a small exhibit provides information about astronomy and the mythological figure after whom each planet is named.

    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/198878783-d17d8b96-23ea-470c-a5ef-11310322223b.png" alt="" width="400" />

- [ ] **Stockholm Metro Ventilation Art** 

    Different patterns can be found in the new metros. The first is a set of three crowns, which is the national emblem of Sweden. The second is a set of play, pause, forward, and reverse buttons that symbolize the ties between Sweden and the global music industry. Then there is a Pacman and three ghosts said to be representative of the Swedish gaming industry. Lastly, there are a few oak leaves and stars.
    
    The trains are still being phased in and drive irregularly, your best chance is to find on one the red line. You will need a train ticket to board the metro.

- [ ] **Lappis Scream**

    The student housing area of Stockholm, on Tuesdays at 10 p.m. sharp, you’ll hear a chorus of screams. It’ll sound as though you’re trapped within a horror movie. In reality, it’s the cries of stressed students echoing through the air. Anyone in the area is welcome to join in on the Tuesday night shouting, but only at the designated time. Starting a shout on other days or times will usually result in angry students telling you to keep quiet.

    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/197396418-c79aa19d-eb1c-46af-99ef-530994ac8f51.jpg" alt="" width="400" />

- [ ] **Newton's Apple**

    This moment is commemorated with a giant dangling apple sculpture in Stockholm’s Tekniska Högskolan metro station, near the KTH Royal Institute of Technology. You will need to purchase a subway ticket to see the apple.

- [ ] **White bricks on the Ribbinska Huset**

    The giant red house on Stortorget is decorated with white bricks. The white stones on the red wall represent the head of murdered Swedish nobles. Full story [here](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ribbinska-huset).

- [ ] **Långholmen Crash Site**

    An air show in 1993 could have ended in catastrophe but miraculously, it missed almost everyone. The metro station closest to the site is Hornstull on the red line south of Stockholm central station. From there it's less than 10 minutes walk north to Långholmen.

    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/197397275-3d9cb905-e712-4d51-9335-7fc9be49b60a.jpg" alt="" width="400" />

- [ ] **Morgondagens Väder (Tomorrow's Weather)**

    Each of these molecules is connected to a weather station via the internet and changes color based on the predicted weather. A large molecule in the center represents the temperature, with blue representing cold and red illustrating hot. The molecules together represent the future, and their base represents the past as sedimentary rocks. The installation hangs above an escalator to the left of the passage to the train platforms at T-Centralen. 

    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/197397361-a4b030bc-6700-4253-9a60-37388c3825a4.jpg" alt="" width="400" />

- [ ] **Järnpojke**

    Järnpojke (Iron Boy) is a small statue that stands in a church courtyard in Stockholm’s old town, Gamla Stan. This 15-centimeter artwork is known as Sweden’s tiniest public monument. This charming artwork is beloved by locals. They care for the boy and adorn him with clothes and items based on current affairs or weather. He is often also surrounded by coins from various countries: it is believed that the Iron Boy bestows good luck upon those who rub his head or give him a small gift.

- [ ] **A ghost story: the Kymlinge Metro Station**

    The Kymlinge Metro Station, and Silverpilen, the silvery train that is said to haunt its rails, are both quite real. Read the full story [here](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kymlinge-metro-station). The station is closed for visitors but you can get close to the fence. Don't try to get over, the metros go very fast and even if you don't get hit, you'll traumatize the metro driver.

There is a great bonfire in the Skansen, in Lidingö, and numerous places.

## Fika and treats☕

Fika is a coffee break the Swedish style. Swedes have periods of Fika throughout the day to help them refresh their minds and make the most of the day. Commonly, Fika just translates to “coffee and cake,” but it’s a lot more for most Swedes. Fika is a state of mind, a crucial part of Swedish culture, and a must-have part of any day. Fika isn’t just about stocking up on caffeine. This mini-break focuses more on the importance of making time for friends, family, and colleagues in everyday life.
