# Stockholm

Last updated: 09/10/2022

## Prices📈

Sweden is a bit expensive. In general, it is twice as costly as Hungary. Services involving people tend to be even more expensive. Some cheaper grocery stores have similar prices to Hungary.

Sweden uses Swedish Kronor (SEK). 1 SEK ~ 0.1 € ~ 38 HUF. They don’t accept Euro (usually). Don’t bring cash, it is hard to pay by cash here. I recommend to use Revolut and have a SEK account there.


## Airport transfer✈️

### Arlanda

![https://www.travelnews.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/arlandaexpress.jpg](https://www.travelnews.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/arlandaexpress.jpg)

Read a great summary [here](https://www.sweetsweden.com/tourism-travel-sweden/the-cheapest-way-to-travel-between-arlanda-airport-and-stockholm/).

- If you want to go cheap, you can travel for free with public transport ticket, but you need to take bus line 583, then a commuter train at Märsta Station (if you go to Stockholm). It takes roughly 90 minutes.
- If you wanna go relatively cheap, there is [FlixBus](https://global.flixbus.com/) or [Flygbussarna](https://www.flygbussarna.se/) between Arlanda and T-Centralen (Stockholm City Center). It takes around 50 minutes, costs around 110 SEK.
- If you wanna go super fast but expensive, take the [Arlanda Express](https://www.arlandaexpress.com/). It is a high-speed train making the way only in 18 minutes, costs 149 SEK.

### Skavsta

[](https://dms-api.ntm.eu/api/v1/images/er9y4w5l/smart/width/1200/height/675)[https://dms-api.ntm.eu/api/v1/images/er9y4w5l/smart/width/1200/height/675](https://dms-api.ntm.eu/api/v1/images/er9y4w5l/smart/width/1200/height/675)

There are good and bad news: Skavsta airport is actually not anywhere close to Stockholm, but 100 km away. The good part: the airport is small, the security check-in is not that strict, and you cannot get lost. You need around 1.5 hour from Stockholm city center to get there.

- I recommend [Flygbussarna](https://www.flygbussarna.se/) between Skavsta and T-Centralen (Stockholm City Center). It takes around 90 minutes, costs around 210 SEK. Buy your ticket before getting to the station, because it costs more there.


## Public Transport🚇

You should buy a ticket with the SL company (like BKV, but in Stockholm). It is expensive, but the service is great, and you can get anywhere for free (including ferries, commuter trains within Stockholm county). [Tickets](https://sl.se/privat/biljetter/kop-biljett) (The 72 hour ticket is 330 SEK, the 7 day ticket costs 420 SEK). Unfortunatelly the student ticket is only valid with a Mecenat card, no international or EU compatible student ID is accepted. Download the [SL app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sl.SLBiljetter) to buy your ticket (you can travel with it while being offline).


## What to do💡

### Walking and sightseeing

- **Gamla Stan (with Stortorget and Mårten Trotzigs Gränd)** 🆓
    The old city with historical and medieval streets, souvenir shops, fika places, and with the tightest street in Stockholm.

- **Kungsträdgården** 🆓
    Nice park with water, seagulls, and green areas. They sell great churros nearby. The origin of the Stockholm Syndrome is originated from a bank robbery which happened nearby.

- **Djurgården ferry** 🆓
    Start the ride from Slussen. Free with an SL ticket, and gives a nice overview of the inner city. You can see Gröna Lund too and hear people screaming on the way.
    
    [](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CttaU9nWYAATBy1?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CttaU9nWYAATBy1?format=jpg&name=4096x4096](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CttaU9nWYAATBy1?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)
    
- **Djurgården** 🆓
    One of my favourite places in the city. It is a very nice island with tons of museums. Apart from them, I usually come here to the park walk around and enjoy the sun. It used to be a hunting venue of the royal family.
    
    ![http://www.notabletravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Djurgarden-blue-gates-Stockholm-Sweden-1024x720.jpg](http://www.notabletravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Djurgarden-blue-gates-Stockholm-Sweden-1024x720.jpg)
    
- **Drottninggatan** 🆓
    It is a major pedestrian street with many shops and restaurants. Quite busy.
    
    ![https://live.staticflickr.com/2815/33112059944_3ffc15f8b1_b.jpg](https://live.staticflickr.com/2815/33112059944_3ffc15f8b1_b.jpg)
    
- **Short trip at Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan** 🆓
    This is the Technical University where I studied. I recommend to visit the main campus, the garden in front of it, and the library. The libary is open during weekdays usually, but check the opening hours (https://www.kth.se/en/biblioteket).
    
    ![https://studyinsweden.se/transformations/2013/10/KTH-Borggården_Jann-Lipka-870x579-1.jpg-1920x.jpg](https://studyinsweden.se/transformations/2013/10/KTH-Borgg%C3%A5rden_Jann-Lipka-870x579-1.jpg-1920x.jpg)
    
- **Skeppsholmen** 🆓
    It is a small island next to Djurgarden, with a fortress and a nice lookout. The Djurgården ferry stops here.
    
    ![https://vadhanderistockholm.se/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/07/Skeppsholmen.png](https://vadhanderistockholm.se/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/07/Skeppsholmen.png)
    
- **Långholmen** 🆓
    It is a smaller island with nice area and green places. There used to be a prison here which is a museum and a hotel nowadays.

- **Svampen** 🆓
    A popular meeting place in Stockholm. This is the area where Avicii grew up. Svampen means mushroom.
    
    ![https://preview.redd.it/c0bonjzkujq61.jpg?auto=webp&s=243f4d46131b23f24e042eb353b7ff5d50fd746b](https://preview.redd.it/c0bonjzkujq61.jpg?auto=webp&s=243f4d46131b23f24e042eb353b7ff5d50fd746b)
    

### Activities

- **Spotify HQ visit** 🆓
    I can show you around the HQ, where we can also play games, have karaoke, and enjoy the view of Stockholm.

- **Gröna Lund** around 500 SEK (prices vary)
    An amazing amusement park. They offer half day tickets (Ticket to Ride), almost every ride is for free. The ticket is expensive, but personally I liked this place very much. They have a night option too (Night Rider) for even higher prices. They have seasonal events as well, like Oktoberfest or Halloween. [Link](https://www.google.com/search?q=gr%C3%B6na+lund)
    
    ![https://images.ctfassets.net/ds6dz7ilx8up/ZXtEBRQQw4xqpoG1ZRNtx/8eb066ca70a8b4ac2a48244ef90b887a/gronan-vybild-social-media-image-1200x630.jpg](https://images.ctfassets.net/ds6dz7ilx8up/ZXtEBRQQw4xqpoG1ZRNtx/8eb066ca70a8b4ac2a48244ef90b887a/gronan-vybild-social-media-image-1200x630.jpg)
    
- **Vaxholm by ferry** 🆓
    [Vaxholm](https://www.google.com/search?q=vaxholm+fortress) is a fortress in the archipelago. The fortress itself is not that extraordinary, but the ferry ride and the area is. One can get there by ferry for free with an SL pass during weekdays ([line 83](https://appassets.mvtdev.com/map/155/l/1083/26618759.pdf)). On weekends, a ticket is needed. It is relatively far, takes around 80 minutes to get there, so it is a (half)day trip going there and coming back. I do not necessarily recommend to go to the fortress museum, it costs 100 SEK. It is possible to take a bus to/from Vaxholm too.
    
    There are good restaurants there, like Boulangerie Bistro (Italian/Swedish food), Hamnkrogen (Swedish dishes).

- **Hiking at Tyresta National Park** 🆓
    Stockholm has numerous great hiking venues all around the city. Tyresta is a National Park having many hiking trails starting from 5 km to even 30 km. I hiked on the short trail, it took me around 2 hours. This is definitely a (half)day activity as it takes around 1-1,5 hour to get there by public transport. [Link](https://www.google.com/search?q=gr%C3%B6na+lund)
    
    ![https://sverigesnationalparker.se/globalassets/tyresta/upplevelser-945x500/tyresta-nationalpark-vandring.jpg](https://sverigesnationalparker.se/globalassets/tyresta/upplevelser-945x500/tyresta-nationalpark-vandring.jpg)
    
- **Drottningholm slott** 💸
    Versailles of Sweden. As everything is relatively small in Stockholm, don’t expect too much, and it is a bit far from the city center (around 40 minutes). The royal family lives there, but the castle can be visited with a ticket (it costs around 110-200 SEK, depending on the type). The whole castle is on an island, which served as a hunting venue for the royal family. It has a nice green area with lakes and fountains, just as you would expect from a royal family. There are also other buildings nearby, such as the chinese pavilion. [Link](https://www.kungligaslotten.se/english/royal-palaces-and-sites/drottningholm-palace.html)

- **Sigtuna 🆓**
    A cozy little viking village around 1-1,5 hour from Stockholm by public transport. This was the old capital of Sweden, which lost its influence after Stockholm started to collect tax from passing ships between Sigtuna and the sea. The city does not have much things to show in general. During winter, it has a nice charm, the sunsets are beautiful, and people usually do hiking or ice-skating on the frozen sea. I bought my Tomte here.

- **Kayaking** 270 SEK
    I was there previously, and I loved it. Link to a great place: [LEK MER | Pampas kajak & SUP](https://www.lekmer.nu/tour/hyra-kajak/). Renting out a double kayak is 540 SEK for 2 hours, which is ideal. Going around the whole island of Stadshagen is possible in 2 hours. Being more chill and avoiding waves, one can just go through the tunnel until reaching the Stadshuseet.
    Pampas Marina is a restaurant right next to the kayaking place. They offer all you can eat lunch and great food, but watch out for the seagulls.

- **Fox in a Box** around 350 SEK
    It is an escape room place, and they also have boardgames to play. [Link](https://foxinabox.se/)
    
    ![https://static.thatsup.co/content/img/place/f/o/fox-in-a-box-cafe-3.jpg](https://static.thatsup.co/content/img/place/f/o/fox-in-a-box-cafe-3.jpg)
    
- **Lappis beach** 🆓
    Lappis is a nice student area. It is close to the nature, and has great surroundings to walk. There is a Japanese pond and a botanical garden nearby. It is relatively far from the city center (no light pollution), so chances are to see the aurora. It is more likely in Jan-Feb, but it happened in Aug too (unlikely though). If you wanna hunt the aurora, download [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jrustonapps.myauroraforecast) app from the Play Store. When it alerts you that there is a chance, and the sky is clear, go to the beach to see it. You need a KP index higher than 4-5 to see it.

- **Djurönäset Konferens & Hotell**
    A SPA and conference venue with a hotel and restaurant in the woods. It is located in the archipelago (30 minutes from Stockholm by car). I don't know if there is public tansport there. A little bit pricey, but the atmosphere is nice. You can go to the sauna, enjoy the outdoor pool, or dip into the sea. [Link](https://djuronaset.com)
