You can find my travel docs in this reposiroty.

## How to use these documents

I wrote these files in Markdown because it is easier to track changes and faster to edit. However, while traveling, it is better to have a nested map and quick edit options (similar to Docs). This is why you should use these files in an editor while traveling. I recommend [Notion](www.notion.so). It is free and good enough to have nested maps and quick editing. They have phone apps ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=notion.id), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notion-notes-docs-tasks/id1232780281)).

How to set up your travel file:

1. Download the selected document to your device.
2. Open Notion, tap **...** (top right), then **import** > **Text & Markdown**. In the pop-up, select the `.md` file on your device.
3. Set cover, remove the top images if they disturb you.
4. Tap **Tavel Map**, which opens my map. Copy it so you can add/remove your landmarks.

5. On your map, tap **Share** and enable the option **Anyone with this link can view**. When you set this, the public URL on the bottom becomes active. Copy it.

6. Head back to Notion. Add a new **Google Maps** item. Set the URL to your copied value, and you are done.

7. The last step: you need to set the subtitles to be collapseable. For each subtitle (around 20), tap **open menu** > **Turn into** > **Toggle Heading <level>**. Most of the subtitles are *Heading 2*, so you need to select *Toggle Heading 2*. You can see the level of each text by selecting it.

I know there are quite a few steps, but I could not come up with a better option yet.
