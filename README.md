# Travel

You can find my travel documents here.

## Map

The linked Map in each document is view-only. I recommend you to:
1. Make a copy of the original document
2. Copy the map linked by the original document on Google Maps (so you can edit your version)
3. Replace the map link to **your map**'s link in **your document**
