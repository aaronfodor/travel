## How to use these documents

I wrote these files in Markdown because it is easier to track changes and faster to edit. However, while traveling, it is better to have a nested map and quick edit options (similar to Docs). This is why you should use these files in an editor while traveling. I recommend [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). The basic version is free and good enough to have nested maps and quick editing. They have phone apps ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=md.obsidian), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/obsidian-connected-notes/id1557175442)).

How to set up your travel file:
1. Download the selected document to your device.
2. Open Obsidian, tap **Open folder as vault**, then select the folder where your `.md` file resides.
3. Tap **Tavel Map**, which opens the default map. Copy it so you can add/remove your landmarks.

4. On your map, tap **Share** and enable the option **Anyone with this link can view**. When you set this, the public URL on the bottom becomes active. Copy it.

5. Head back to Obsidian, and update the link URL to your copied value.

I know there are quite a few steps, but I could not come up with a better option yet.
