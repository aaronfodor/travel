# Budapest

Last updated: 23/10/2022

## [Map Link](https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=11h2trbapoGKTJSLP9WcK_n-qi2Q5YYg&ehbc=2E312F)🗺️

## Prices📈

Hungary is considered to be a cheap country in Europe. In general, prices are a bit more than a half compared to Sweden.

Forint (HUF) is the Hungarian currency. 1 EUR ~ 416 HUF (live data [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=eur+huf)). In Budapest, most of the places accept credit card. You can use EUR, but they charge you more (like 1 EUR = 300-350 HUF), so watch out. I recommend to use Revolut and have a HUF account there.

## Airport transfer✈️

To travel between BUD airport and the city center (Deák Ferenc Tér), you can take the airpot shuttle bus line 100E for 3 EUR.

## Public Transport🚇

Public transport in Budapest is good. It can be cheap, and the network is great. The company is called BKV, and the public transport app is Budapest GO ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hu.webvalto.bkkfutar&hl=en&gl=US), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/budapestgo/id916193835)).

Tickets for tourists are a bit tricky. They offer travelcards and the Budapest Card for tourists. Total summary of prices are [here](https://bkk.hu/en/tickets-and-passes/prices/).

- With the [120h Budapest Card](https://bkk.hu/en/tickets-and-passes/prices/travelcards-valid-for-one-or-more-days/budapest-card-for-120-hours.41/) the public transport is free, but it is expensive (18990 HUF for 5 days), and is not worth it in my opinion (I will write about it later).
- The [Seven-day Budapest travelcard](https://bkk.hu/en/tickets-and-passes/prices/travelcards-valid-for-one-or-more-days/budapest-weekly-ticket.35/) is a better option (4950 HUF), which is for a week.
- The [Monthly Budapest-pass](https://bkk.hu/en/tickets-and-passes/prices/monthly-passes/monthly-budapest-pass.58/) costs 9500 HUF. With that, you can take the BKV ferry ride for free (only free with a monthly pass).
- Students: bring your student Id, and buy a monthly Budapest pass for students for only 3450 HUF. For that, you need a student Id with the requirements stated [here](https://bkk.hu/en/tickets-and-passes/prices/monthly-passes/monthly-budapest-pass-for-students.61/) (your name, school name, validity, etc. must be on the card - a valid Mecenat is fine).

⚠️ Each summer, there are massive construction works around the city. Tram line 4-6 is usually affected, as well as metro line 3. ⚠️

## Public Transport alternatives🚴‍♀️

The inner-city has many attractions in walking distance, but I recommend to buy a public transpot ticket, because many things are far from there.

Budapest is not that biker friendly, but there are some nice paths (not as many as in Stockholm or Copenhagen). There is a great bike rental service called [MOL BUBI](https://molbubi.hu/en/). They have tons of different stations (170+) across the city, so to travel around and discover, it might come handy. With BUBI, you take a bike from A, and drop it at B. It costs 20 HUF (0.05€) per minute, and there is a monthly pass which is 500 HUF (1.5€), with which the first 30 minutes of each ride is for free.

There are other rental services in Budapest, for example [Lime](https://www.li.me/). They have electric bikes and scooters.


## Car rental/carsharing🚗

If you stay only in Budapest, you don't really need a car. The public transport is great, and there is a cheap airport shuttle line.

[MOL LIMO](https://www.mollimo.hu/en/) is the same as MOL BUBI but with cars. It is possible to can rent cars in a minute-based manner (80 HUF or 0.2€/min), or with a daily fee (16000 HUF or 40€/day). You don’t need to pay to refuel the car, that is included. They charge an extra fee after 100 KM/day, which you would exceed on the way to Balaton (which is around 130 KM from Budapest). The maximum rental period is 3 days (which means if you go outside of Budapest, you need to return in 3 days, but then, you can rent again). [Here](https://www.mollimo.hu/en/rates) are the prices.

## Restaurants🍴

In Hungary, restaurants charge you 10-15 % service fee on top of the prices shown (🙄). They are obliged to mention this in their menu. You don't need to give any additional tip. There are many great restaurants in the city, this is just a selection of my favourites.

    One of my favourite restaurants in Budapest. The building is beautiful and has a romantic aura, and the food is very good. Book in advance.

## Coffee and treats☕

- [ ] **Molnár's Kürtőskalács** 💸💸

    This place is specialized serving a Hungarian pastry called the chimney cake (kürtőskalács). They serve it by cutting one cake into half, and putting ice cream inside. I ate the best chimney cake in my life there. They have different flavors, the original is the cinnamon or walnut one, but the chocolate version is also good.

- [ ] **Cafe Frei** (multiple places) 💸💸

    This is a Hungarian coffee chain founded by a journalist called Tamás Frei, who travelled through the world and collected coffee receipes on his way. Similar to Espresso House in Sweden, but the coffee has better quality. They also serve some sweets. I recommend the one at Váci street 74. They also sell coffee beans, their roasted nut coffee from Rome (Római mogyoró kávé) smells amazing.

- [ ] **Bubu Bubble Tea** (Petőfi Sándor utca or Teréz körút) 💸💸

    Bubble tea has nothing to do with Hungarian cousine (it comes from Taiwan), but I like it. Bubble tea is cold. The original is milk-based, but they have non-milk alternatives too.
