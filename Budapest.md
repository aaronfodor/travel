# Budapest

Last updated: 30/10/2022

Budapest is the Hungarian capital, with roughly 1.7 million inhabitants. It is divided by the river Danube (Pest is a flat area, while Buda has more hills and nature). 2-3 days are enough to see the main highlights, but you need 4-5 days to explore this city truly. Go there in the summer (July-August) to enjoy the sunny and hot days.

## [Travel Map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=11h2trbapoGKTJSLP9WcK_n-qi2Q5YYg&ehbc=2E312F)🗺️

## Weather🌡️

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/197390573-b231b912-a96e-4f1f-b973-24e93960a8bf.PNG" alt="" width="400" />

## Prices📈

Hungary is considered to be a cheap country in Europe. In general, prices are a bit more than a half compared to Sweden.

Forint (HUF) is the Hungarian currency. 1 EUR ~ 416 HUF (live data [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=eur+huf)). In Budapest, most of the places accept credit card. You can use EUR, but they charge you more (like 1 EUR = 300-350 HUF), so watch out. I recommend to use Revolut and have a HUF account there.

## Airport transfer✈️

To travel between BUD airport and the city center (Deák Ferenc Tér), you can take the airpot shuttle bus line 100E for 3 EUR.

## Public Transport🚇

Public transport in Budapest is good. It can be cheap, and the network is great. The company is called BKV, and the public transport app is Budapest GO ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hu.webvalto.bkkfutar&hl=en&gl=US), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/budapestgo/id916193835)).

Tickets for tourists are a bit tricky. They offer travelcards and the Budapest Card for tourists. Total summary of prices are [here](https://bkk.hu/en/tickets-and-passes/prices/).

- With the [120h Budapest Card](https://bkk.hu/en/tickets-and-passes/prices/travelcards-valid-for-one-or-more-days/budapest-card-for-120-hours.41/) the public transport is free, but it is expensive (18990 HUF for 5 days), and is not worth it in my opinion.
- The [Seven-day Budapest travelcard](https://bkk.hu/en/tickets-and-passes/prices/travelcards-valid-for-one-or-more-days/budapest-weekly-ticket.35/) is a better option (4950 HUF), which is for a week.
- The [Monthly Budapest-pass](https://bkk.hu/en/tickets-and-passes/prices/monthly-passes/monthly-budapest-pass.58/) costs 9500 HUF.
- Students: bring your student Id, and buy a monthly Budapest pass for students for only 3450 HUF. For that, you need a student Id with the requirements stated [here](https://bkk.hu/en/tickets-and-passes/prices/monthly-passes/monthly-budapest-pass-for-students.61/) (your name, school name, validity, etc. must be on the card - a valid Mecenat is fine).

⚠️ Each summer, there are massive construction works around the city. Tram line 4-6 is usually affected, as well as metro line 3. ⚠️

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/197357413-8205af57-b26d-4284-9868-59a9948ceed7.jpg" alt="public transport system" width="800" />


## Transportation alternatives🚴‍♀️

The inner-city has many attractions in walking distance, but I recommend to buy a public transpot ticket, because many things are far from there.

Budapest is not that biker friendly, but there are some nice paths (not as many as in Stockholm or Copenhagen). There is a great bike rental service called [MOL BUBI](https://molbubi.hu/en/). They have tons of different stations (170+) across the city, so to travel around and discover, it might come handy. With BUBI, you take a bike from A, and drop it at B. It costs 20 HUF (0.05€) per minute, and there is a monthly pass which is 500 HUF (1.5€), with which the first 30 minutes of each ride is for free.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/197357977-d13c5a42-985d-48eb-a4e0-a29f3520748e.jpg" alt="" width="400" />

There are other rental services in Budapest, for example [Lime](https://www.li.me/). They have electric bikes and scooters.


## Car rental/carsharing🚗

If you stay only in Budapest, you don't really need a car. The public transport is great, and there is a cheap airport shuttle line.

[MOL LIMO](https://www.mollimo.hu/en/) is the same as MOL BUBI but with cars. It is possible to can rent cars in a minute-based manner (80 HUF or 0.2€/min), or with a daily fee (16000 HUF or 40€/day). You don’t need to pay to refuel the car, that is included. They charge an extra fee after 100 KM/day, which you would exceed on the way to Balaton (which is around 130 KM from Budapest). The maximum rental period is 3 days (which means if you go outside of Budapest, you need to return in 3 days, but then, you can rent again). [Here](https://www.mollimo.hu/en/rates) are the prices.

### Hidden gems🔍

    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/198882792-34077136-e579-4094-a526-1e5e98abe03f.jpg" alt="" width="400" />

- [ ] **Kiskirálylány (Little Princess)** 🆓

    A statue that was inspired by the sculptor's own daughter exhibited on the Danube Promenade. Fun fact: two notable copies exist, one in the sculptor's hometown of Tapolca. The other is at the concert hall of the Tokyo Metropolitan Theatre, representing the years of friendly Hungarian-Japanese relations.

    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/197421156-234a235a-8fdf-4d40-bebe-f9e41fc115c9.jpg" alt="" width="400" />

- [ ] **Prince of Buda and Princess of Pest Statue** 🆓

    It is a small sculpture positioned on Gellért Hill overlooking the city below. For many years, the towns of Buda, Óbuda, and Pest were separate and independent. In 1873, they were joined together and given the new name Budapest. The bronze and stone sculpture is meant to symbolize the unification of the city.

    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/197421763-4ad00504-1322-4c3b-9121-7159a8ad0def.jpg" alt="" width="400" />

- [ ] **Garden of Philosophers** 🆓

- [ ] **Air Defense Early Warning Listening Ears** 🆓

    The device was used to amplify and monitor the sound of aircraft approaching the city during World War I.

You can find the listening ears by taking the 19 or 41 trams along the Buda riverside. The nearest stop is Várkert Bazár (Castle Garden).

    Hungarian paprika is made from peppers that are harvested and then sorted, toasted, and blended to create different varieties.

- [ ] **Cafe Frei** (multiple places) 💸💸

    This is a Hungarian coffee chain founded by a journalist called Tamás Frei, who travelled through the world and collected coffee receipes on his way. Similar to Espresso House in Sweden, but the coffee has better quality. They also serve some sweets. I recommend the one at Váci street 74. They also sell coffee beans, their roasted nut coffee from Rome (Római mogyoró kávé) smells amazing.

- [ ] **Bubu Bubble Tea** (Petőfi Sándor utca or Teréz körút) 💸💸

    Bubble tea has nothing to do with Hungarian cousine (it comes from Taiwan), but I like it. Bubble tea is cold. The original is milk-based, but they have non-milk alternatives too.

    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37120889/197359218-d530cde3-4955-4969-8c75-db6a87d2d2e8.jpg" alt="" width="400" />
